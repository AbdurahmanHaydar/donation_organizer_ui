2. Sadaqah:
   - Based on the verse from Surah Al-Baqarah (2:261):
   > "The example of those who spend their wealth in the cause of Allah is that of a grain that sprouts into seven ears, each bearing one hundred grains. And Allah multiplies ˹the reward even more˺ to whoever He wills. For Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing."

3. Ramadan:
   - Based on the hadith from Al-Bukhari and Muslim:
   > Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was the most generous of the men; and he was the most generous during the month of Ramadan when Jibril visited him every night and recited the Qur'an to him. During this period, the generosity of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) waxed faster than the rain bearing wind.
